# AboutMe
Config files for my GitHub profile.

Hi my name is Alice and I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto studying the sources, transport, and fate of plastic pollution in the environment. 
I am an environmental analytical scientist who loves to model and work with big datasets. 
I conduct field research and build models to show how plastic pollution is transported through rivers and where it ends up in the ocean. 
Aside from my research, I am also a big environmental advocate who does a lot of work around climate change and increasing waste literacy in my community. 
Welcome to my GitHub page and hope you enjoy the stay!
