# AboutMe
Config files for my GitHub profile.

Hi my name is Alice and I am a postdoctoral researcher at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. I obtained my PhD from the University of Toronto (Canada) and my thesis was on the sources, transport, and fate of plastic pollution in the environment. 
I am an environmental analytical scientist who loves to model and work with big datasets. 
I conduct field research and build models to show how plastic pollution is transported throughout the ocean, how it is transformed over time, and where it ends up. I also study how plastic moves carbon. Much of my plastic pollution research directly informs policy, especially my solutions-based research. 
Aside from my research, I am also a big environmental advocate who does a lot of work around climate change and increasing waste literacy in my community. 
Welcome to my GitHub page and hope you enjoy your stay!
